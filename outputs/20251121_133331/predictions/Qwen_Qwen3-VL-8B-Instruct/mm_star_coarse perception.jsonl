Red, green, and blue are also present, but in smaller quantities or as accents.\n\nTherefore, the dominant color of the clothing worn by people in the image is white.\n\nANSWER: A", "source": "generate", "metadata": null, "internal": null, "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct"}], "metadata": {"index": 80, "category": "coarse perception", "l2_category": "image scene and topic", "source": "SEEDBench_IMG", "split": "val", "image_path": "images/80.jpg"}}

Christmas Eve is the night before Christmas, and it's common to have festive gatherings. The decorated tree and the formality of the event suggest it's a significant Christmas-related event.\n\nC: Birthday celebration - There is no indication of a birthday (e.g., cakes, candles, age references).\n\nD: Wedding reception - There is no wedding-related symbolism (e.g., rings, cake, bridal party).\n\nThe decorations and the overall atmosphere point to a Christmas-related event. Since the tree is lit up and there's a sense of celebration, it's most likely a Christmas Eve party, which is a common gathering before Christmas Day.\n\nANSWER: B", "source": "generate", "metadata": null, "internal": null, "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct"}], "metadata": {"index": 118, "category": "coarse perception", "l2_category": "image scene and topic", "source": "SEEDBench_IMG", "split": "val", "image_path": "images/118.jpg"}}
